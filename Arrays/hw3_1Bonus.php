/*
1)You are going to be given an array of integers.
Your job is to take that array and find an index N where the sum of the integers to the left of N is equal to the sum of the integers to the right of N.
If there is no index that would make this happen, return -1.

For example:
Let's say you are given the array [1,2,3,4,3,2,1] -
Your function will return the index 3, because at the 3rd position of the array,
the sum of left side of the index ([1,2,3]) and the sum of the right side of the index ([3,2,1]) both equal 6.
[1,100,50,-51,1,1] - Your function will return the index 1,
because at the 1st position of the array, the sum of left side of the index ([1])
and the sum of the right side of the index ([50,-51,1,1]) both equal 1.

You need to test the solution on the next arrays:
[20,10,-80,10,10,15,35]
[10,-80,10,10,15,35]
